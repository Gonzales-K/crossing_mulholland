CONCEPT
    This is a sample fashion retail site.
    It will be built using vanilla HTML and CSS.


FEATURES
    Nav bar
    Hero section with image
    Gallery section with images of items
        - these will navigate to the detail page for the item on click

NOTES
    I may eventually incorporate a back end and add user and inventory functionality.
    This is an initial concept and subject to change.
